<h1>Project Description:</h1>
The application allows customers to order a range of dishes, including hot and cold dishes, drinks, and desserts, which are all prepared by our expert chefs. Orders are prepaid, ensuring a smooth and quick checkout process. Each order is assigned a unique "ticket number," which helps customers track their orders and allows the restaurant staff to manage them efficiently.
<br><br>
Our chefs receive notifications for each hot dish ordered and mark them as "ready" when they're prepared. Our delivery employees, who work at the counter, receive notifications when the hot dishes are ready and take responsibility for completing the orders. They deliver the orders to the customers, and once the orders are completed, they mark them as "ready" in the application. Customers receive a notification once their order is ready.
<br><br>
In addition to anonymous users, registered customers can also use our application. Registered customers earn points for every 10‚Ç¨ they spend on an order. They can exchange 10 points for a ‚Ç¨5 discount on any order, and they can accumulate their points. The application also includes a "public board," which lists all orders that are ready but not delivered yet.
<br><br>
The menu for FasTuga is managed by the managers, who can create, edit, or remove products, change prices, etc. All registered customers, employees, including chefs, delivery employees, and managers, have an account on the platform that allows them to log in using their credentials. They can change their profile, view their order history and statistical information about prepared dishes or delivered orders, etc.
<br><br>
Managers can view and manage all accounts, including blocking/unblocking and deleting users. Registered customers are associated with a user, which includes a phone, a NIF, the default payment type and reference, and the total points owned by the customer.
<br><br>
Orders can be cancelled by a manager for any valid reason. In such cases, the restaurant refunds the amount paid by the customer and revokes any points awarded or used in that order.
<br><br>
Overall, our SPA application for FasTuga ensures that customers have a seamless and hassle-free dining experience. Our efficient system ensures that orders are prepared quickly, and customers can easily track their orders. Our registered customers can also earn points and exchange them for discounts, which encourages loyalty and helps the restaurant retain customers.
